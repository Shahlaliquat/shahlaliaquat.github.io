[Web Traffic Analysis](/sample_page)

In the digital age, understanding how users interact with a website is crucial for improving user experience and achieving business goals. Recently, I was tasked with analyzing my website's traffic data to gain insights into user behavior, identify high-performing content, and optimize marketing strategies. Using Power BI, I created a dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends in web traffic, user engagement, and conversion tracking.
