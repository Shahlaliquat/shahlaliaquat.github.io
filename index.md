#### [Analyzing Student Mental Health in SQL](https://github.com/Shahlaliquat/Analyzing-students-mental-health-in-SQL)
In this project, I utilized MySQL to analyze survey data from a 2018 study on the mental health of Japanese international students. The objective was to examine how the duration of students' stays in the host country affects their mental health. By leveraging database analysis, the project aims to understand the challenges faced by international students and the role of their length of stay in these mental health issues.
